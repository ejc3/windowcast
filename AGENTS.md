## Session values stay out of the repository

A value copied from a working session (a shell, an environment variable, a launch command or
a transcript) is not useful to the repository and goes stale: profile names, account names,
one-off paths, model names, local ports. Don't put one in a file, a comment, a commit
message, or a pull request title, description or review comment. Use a variable or a made-up
placeholder (`example-profile`, `example-name`). Where something specific has to be named,
use its publicly documented identifier. Check the diff, the commit messages and the PR text
before every push.
